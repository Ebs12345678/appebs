            <h6>What is a Liquidation of the company? </h6>
            <p>
              Liquidation (or “Winding up”) is a process by which a company’s
              existence is brought to an end.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              First, a liquidator is appointed, either by the shareholders or
              the court if there is some dispute. The Liquidator represents the
              interests of all creditors. The Liquidator supervises the
              liquidation, which involves collecting and realizing the company’s
              assets (turning them into cash), discharging the company’s
              liabilities, and distributing any funds left over among the
              shareholders in accordance with the company’s constitution. After
              these steps have been carried out, the company is formally
              dissolved. We can get one Deregistration Certificate from the
              Licensing Authority.
